# Anonymous Quality Testing System

A privacy-preserving quality inspection platform built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling anonymous quality control processes while maintaining complete data confidentiality and integrity.

## 🔒 Core Concepts

### Privacy-Preserving Quality Inspection
Our system revolutionizes traditional quality control by implementing **anonymous quality detection** that protects sensitive manufacturing and inspection data while maintaining transparency and accountability.

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Smart Contract
The platform utilizes cutting-edge FHE technology to ensure that all quality scores, defect counts, and batch numbers remain encrypted on-chain, making them accessible only to authorized personnel while preserving complete anonymity.

### Confidential Inspection Data
- **Quality Scores**: Encrypted assessment ratings (0-100)
- **Defect Counts**: Anonymous defect tracking
- **Batch Numbers**: Confidential product identification
- **Inspector Identity**: Privacy-protected authorization system
